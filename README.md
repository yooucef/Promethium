```

**PyPI Package:** [https://pypi.org/project/promethium-seismic/1.0.4/](https://pypi.org/project/promethium-seismic/1.0.4/)

This installs the core library with minimal dependencies, suitable for most use cases including Kaggle and Google Colab notebooks.

#### Optional Dependencies

Install with visualization support:

```bash
pip install promethium-seismic[viz]==1.0.0
```

Install with server components (FastAPI, Celery, Redis) for backend deployment:

```bash
pip install promethium-seismic[server]==1.0.0
```

Install all optional dependencies:

```bash
pip install promethium-seismic[all]==1.0.0
```

Install development dependencies:

```bash
pip install promethium-seismic[dev]==1.0.0
```

## 📚 Documentation

For detailed information on the mathematical models, algorithms, and methodologies used in Promethium, please refer to the [**Math & Methodology Guide**](docs/methodology.md).

*   [**Installation Guide**](README.md#installation)
*   [**Quick Start**](README.md#quick-start)
*   [**Kaggle Integration**](docs/kaggle-integration.md)
*   [**Notebooks**](docs/notebooks-overview.md)
*   [**Full API Reference**](docs/api-reference.md)

### Kaggle Integration

Promethium is designed to be **Kaggle-native**, supporting both standard PyPI installation and offline/pip-less usage via Kaggle Datasets.

**Quick References:**
*   [Kaggle Integration Guide](docs/kaggle-integration.md) (Full Documentation)
*   [Pip-less Source Usage Example](notebooks/kaggle/01_pipless_source_dataset_usage.ipynb)
*   [Offline Wheel Install Example](notebooks/kaggle/02_local_wheel_install.ipynb)

#### Standard PyPI Usage (Network Required)

```python
!pip install promethium-seismic==1.0.4
import promethium
```

#### Offline / Pip-less Usage (Competitions)

You can attach the **Promethium Wheel Dataset** or **Source Dataset** to your notebook to use the library without internet access.

```python
# Mode A: Pip-less Source Import
import sys
sys.path.append("/kaggle/input/promethium-seismic-source-100")
import promethium

# Mode B: Offline Wheel Install
!pip install ../input/promethium-seismic-wheel-100/promethium_seismic-1.0.4-py3-none-any.whl
```


import promethium
from promethium import read_segy, SeismicRecoveryPipeline

# Load seismic data (from Kaggle input or uploaded file)
data = read_segy("/kaggle/input/seismic-dataset/survey.sgy")

# Create and run reconstruction pipeline
pipeline = SeismicRecoveryPipeline.from_preset("unet_denoise_v1")
result = pipeline.run(data)

# Evaluate reconstruction quality
metrics = promethium.evaluate_reconstruction(data.values, result)
print(metrics)
```

Key considerations for notebook environments:
- GPU acceleration is automatically enabled when available
- The core library works on CPU-only environments
- Use `/kaggle/input/...` paths for Kaggle datasets
- Use `/content/...` paths for Colab uploaded files

### Prerequisites (for Development or Server Deployment)

For full development or server deployment, ensure the following software is installed:

- **Python**: Version 3.10 or higher
- **Node.js**: Version 20 or higher (for frontend development)
- **Docker**: Version 24 or higher (for containerized deployment)
- **Docker Compose**: Version 2.20 or higher

### Clone the Repository (for Development)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/olaflaitinen/promethium.git
cd promethium
```

### Option 1: Docker Deployment

The recommended approach for running the full Promethium server stack:

```bash
# Copy environment template and configure
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration

# Build and start all services
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up --build -d

# Verify services are running
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml ps
```

The following services will be available:

| Service | URL | Description |
|---------|-----|-------------|
| Frontend | http://localhost:4200 | Angular web application |
| Backend API | http://localhost:8000 | FastAPI REST API |
| API Documentation | http://localhost:8000/docs | Interactive OpenAPI documentation |

### Option 2: Local Development Setup

For development without Docker:

```bash
# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate

# Linux/macOS
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install in editable mode with dev dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev,server]"

# Run tests
pytest tests/ -v

# Start the backend API server
uvicorn src.promethium.api.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

# Load reconstruction model
model = load_model("unet-v2-reconstruction")

# Perform reconstruction
reconstructed = reconstruct(model, filtered, missing_traces=[10, 15, 23])

# Save results
reconstructed.to_segy("path/to/reconstructed.sgy")
```

### Recommended Learning Path

1. Start with **01_quickstart_basic_usage** for a minimal working example
2. Continue to **02_data_ingestion** to understand data loading
3. Explore **03_signal_processing** for preprocessing techniques
4. Move to **05_deep_learning_unet** for ML-based reconstruction
5. Use **08_kaggle_and_colab** for cloud deployment

See [docs/notebooks-overview.md](docs/notebooks-overview.md) for detailed documentation.

## AI/ML and Data Engineering Highlights

### Supported Model Architectures

| Model Family | Variants | Use Case |
|--------------|----------|----------|
| U-Net | Standard, Attention U-Net, Residual U-Net | General reconstruction, denoising |
| Autoencoder | VAE, Denoising AE, Sparse AE | Feature extraction, compression |
| GAN | Pix2Pix, SRGAN-adapted | High-fidelity reconstruction |
| PINN | Wave-constrained, Velocity-informed | Physics-consistent reconstruction |
| Transformer | Vision Transformer, Swin Transformer | Long-range dependency modeling |

### Training Workflow

1. **Data Preparation**: Convert seismic data to training-ready format with configurable patch extraction.
2. **Augmentation**: Apply domain-specific augmentations including noise injection, trace masking, and amplitude scaling.
3. **Training**: Distributed training with mixed precision, gradient accumulation, and early stopping.
4. **Validation**: Continuous validation with seismic-specific metrics.
5. **Checkpointing**: Model versioning with MLflow integration.

### Evaluation Metrics

- **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)**: Improvement in SNR after reconstruction.
- **Structural Similarity Index (SSIM)**: Perceptual quality measure.
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Pixel-wise reconstruction error.
- **Coherence Preservation**: Cross-correlation of reconstructed versus reference.
- **Spectral Fidelity**: Frequency content preservation analysis.

## Performance and Benchmarking

### Performance Targets

| Operation | Target Throughput | Notes |
|-----------|-------------------|-------|
| SEG-Y Ingestion | 500 MB/s | SSD storage, streaming mode |
| Trace Filtering | 10,000 traces/s | Single CPU core |
| U-Net Inference | 100 gathers/s | NVIDIA A100 GPU |
| Reconstruction Job | < 5 min for 10 GB | Full pipeline, GPU-enabled |

### Benchmarking Suite

Promethium includes a comprehensive benchmarking suite for performance evaluation:

```bash
# Run full benchmark suite
python -m promethium.benchmarks.run_all

# Run specific benchmarks
python -m promethium.benchmarks.io_throughput
python -m promethium.benchmarks.ml_inference
```

For detailed benchmarking methodology and result interpretation, see [docs/benchmarking.md](docs/benchmarking.md).

| Storage | Data storage paths and backends | `storage.*` |
| ML | Model paths, inference settings | `ml.*` |
| API | Server settings, CORS, rate limiting | `api.*` |
| Workers | Celery worker configuration | `workers.*` |

### Environment Variables

Essential environment variables:

```bash
# Database
PROMETHIUM_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/promethium

# Redis
