Promethium is a production-grade, state-of-the-art framework designed for the systematic recovery, reconstruction, and enhancement of multi-channel seismic data. It unifies classical geophysical signal processing with modern deep learning architectures to address challenges in seismic data quality, including missing traces, noise contamination, and irregular sampling.

## Key Features

- **Seismic Data Ingestion**: High-performance I/O for industry-standard formats including SEG-Y, SEG-2, miniSEED, and SAC.
- **Signal Conditioning**: Industrial-grade modules for bandpass filtering, notch filtering, spectral gating, and predictive deconvolution.
- **Advanced Recovery Algorithms**: Implementation of Matrix Completion (SoftImpute, Nuclear Norm Minimization) and Compressive Sensing/L1 minimization strategies.
- **Deep Learning Integration**: PyTorch-based U-Net architectures, Denoising Autoencoders, and Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) specific to wavefield reconstruction.
- **Job Orchestration**: Asynchronous task management using Celery and Redis for handling terabyte-scale datasets.
- **Interactive Visualization**: React-based dashboard for real-time job monitoring, dataset inspection, and quality control.
- **Scalable Deployment**: Fully dockerized architecture supporting microservices and cloud-native deployment.

## Architecture Summary

Promethium follows a modular, layered architecture:

- **Core Library (`src/promethium/core`)**: Fundamental data models (`SeismicTrace`, `SeismicDataset`), configuration, and logging.
- **I/O Layer (`src/promethium/io`)**: Robust readers and writers with memory-mapping capabilities.
- **Signal Processing (`src/promethium/signal`)**: Classical filtering and deconvolution routines.
- **Machine Learning (`src/promethium/ml`)**: Neural network models, training pipelines, and inference logic.
- **Backend API (`src/promethium/api`)**: FASTAPI-based REST interface.
- **Workflows (`src/promethium/workflows`)**: Distributed task definitions.

For a detailed breakdown, please refer to the [Architecture Documentation](docs/architecture.md).

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Docker Engine (v20.10+)
- Docker Compose (v2.0+)

### Running the Full Stack

To simplify evaluation, Promethium provides a Docker Compose configuration that orchestrates the API, Worker, Database (PostgreSQL), and Message Broker (Redis).

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/olaflaitinen/Promethium.git
   cd Promethium
   ```

2. **Launch Services**
   ```bash
   docker compose up --build -d
   ```

3. **Access Interfaces**
   - **Web Dashboard**: http://localhost:8000 (Hosted via API static mount or separate frontend service)
   - **API Documentation**: http://localhost:8000/docs

### Local Development (Python)

For algorithm development without Docker:

```bash
# Create environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -e .[dev]

# Run tests
pytest tests/
```

## Use Cases

- **Exploration Geophysics**: Enhancing legacy datasets with sparse acquisition geometries.
- **Reservoir Characterization**: Removing coherent noise to improve attribute analysis.
- **Earthquake Monitoring**: Reconstructing gaps in continuous waveform streams.

## Future Roadmap

The following features are planned for upcoming releases (`v0.2.0` and `v0.3.0`) and are partially scaffolded in the repository:

### Phase 2: Advanced Recovery
- **PINNs (`src/promethium/ml/pinns.py`)**: Implementation of Physics-Informed Neural Networks enforcing wave-equation constraints.
- **Matrix Completion**: Optimization of SoftImpute algorithms using Numba/Cython for production speed.
- **Interactive Plots**: Integration of Plotly.js/Canvas for high-performance real-time seismic visualization in the dashboard.

### Phase 3: Scale & Cloud
- **Kubernetes Support**: Helm charts for cluster-based deployment.
- **Cloud Storage (`src/promethium/io/cloud.py`)**: S3/Azure Blob Storage adapters for the I/O layer.
- **Distributed Training**: Multi-GPU support functionality using PyTorch Lightning.
