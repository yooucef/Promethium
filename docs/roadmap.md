# Roadmap

> **Disclaimer**: This roadmap is tentative and subject to change based on community feedback and research priorities.

## Near Term (v2.1)
*   **Advanced PINNs**: Implementation of Elastic Wave Equation (multi-component) constraints.
*   **3D Visualization**: WebGL-based volume rendering in the browser.
*   **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Integration with Ray Tune or Optuna for automated parameter search.

## Mid Term (v3.0)
*   **Transformer Models**: Implementation of Swin-Transformer and Vision Transformers for seismic processing.
*   **Real-time Streaming**: Full support for Kafka-based streaming ingestion and inference.
*   **Cloud Native Ops**: Helm charts for Kubernetes deployment and Terraform scripts for AWS/GCP.

## Long Term
*   **Foundation Models**: Pretraining a large-scale seismic foundation model on public archives.
*   **Edge Deployment**: Quantized models for running on edge devices (nodes, buoys).
