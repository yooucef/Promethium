# Glossary

*   **CMP (Common Midpoint)**: A point on the surface halfway between the source and receiver.
*   **Gather**: A collection of seismic traces that share a common geometric attribute (e.g., Common Shot Gather, Common Midpoint Gather).
*   **Inference**: The process of applying a trained model to new data to generate predictions (reconstructions).
*   **PINN (Physics-Informed Neural Network)**: A neural network trained with a loss function that includes a term representing the residual of a governing physics equation (e.g., Wave Equation).
*   **SEG-Y**: The standard file format developed by the Society of Exploration Geophysicists for storing geophysical data.
*   **SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio)**: A metric measuring the strength of the desired signal relative to background noise.
*   **SSIM (Structural Similarity Index)**: A perceptual metric that quantifies the degradation of structural information in an image/signal.
*   **Trace**: A single time-series recording from one receiver channel.
*   **Zarr**: A format for the storage of chunked, compressed, N-dimensional arrays.
