# Mathematical Methodology and Models

This document details the mathematical foundations and model architectures used in the Promethium library.

## 1. Evaluation Metrics

### Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)
The Signal-to-Noise Ratio measures the ratio of signal power to noise power, expressed in decibels (dB).

$$
\text{SNR}_{dB} = 10 \log_{10} \left( \frac{P_{signal}}{P_{noise}} \right)
$$

Where power $P$ is calculated as the mean squared amplitude:
$$
P_{signal} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} y_i^2, \quad P_{noise} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2
$$

### Structural Similarity Index (SSIM)
SSIM measures the perceived quality of the reconstructed signal by comparing luminance, contrast, and structure.

$$
\text{SSIM}(x, y) = \frac{(2\mu_x\mu_y + C_1)(2\sigma_{xy} + C_2)}{(\mu_x^2 + \mu_y^2 + C_1)(\sigma_x^2 + \sigma_y^2 + C_2)}
$$

Where:
*   $\mu_x, \mu_y$: Local means of $x$ and $y$.
*   $\sigma_x^2, \sigma_y^2$: Local variances.
*   $\sigma_{xy}$: Local covariance.
*   $C_1, C_2$: Constants to stabilize division.

## 2. Signal Processing Transforms

### Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
We use the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to analyze the frequency content of seismic traces.

$$
X_k = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n e^{-i 2\pi k n / N}
$$

### Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT)
Decomposes a signal into wavelets, which are localized in both time and frequency.

$$
W(a, b) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{a}} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(t) \psi^*\left(\frac{t-b}{a}\right) dt
$$

Where:
*   $\psi$: Mother wavelet (e.g., Morlet).
*   $a$: Scale parameter (related to frequency).
*   $b$: Translation parameter (time shift).

## 3. Reconstruction Algorithms

### Compressive Sensing (ISTA)
We employ the Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (ISTA) to recover missing seismic data by exploiting sparsity in a transform domain (e.g., DCT or Curvelet).

**Optimization Objective:**
$$
\min_x \frac{1}{2} ||y - \Phi x||_2^2 + \lambda ||\Psi x||_1
$$

Where:
*   $y$: Observed data (with missing traces).
*   $\Phi$: Sampling operator (masking).
*   $\Psi$: Sparsifying transform.
*   $\lambda$: Regularization parameter.

**Update Rule:**
$$
x_{k+1} = \mathcal{S}_{\lambda \alpha} \left( x_k + \alpha \Phi^T (y - \Phi x_k) \right)
$$
Where $\mathcal{S}$ is the soft-thresholding operator:
$$
\mathcal{S}_{\tau}(u) = \text{sign}(u) \max(|u| - \tau, 0)
$$

## 4. Deep Learning Architectures

### U-Net (Seismic Denoising & Recovery)
The U-Net is a fully convolutional network with an encoder-decoder structure and skip connections. It is highly effective for image-to-image tasks like seismic data restoration.

**Architecture:**
1.  **Encoder (Contracting Path)**:
    *   Sequence of `Conv2D` -> `BatchNorm` -> `LeakyReLU`.
    *   Max pooling for downsampling.
    *   Captures context and high-level features.
2.  **Decoder (Expansive Path)**:
    *   `UpSample` (Bilinear or Transpose Conv).
    *   Concatenation with corresponding encoder feature maps (skip connections).
    *   Recovers spatial resolution.
3.  **Output**:
    *   1x1 Convolution to map features to the output space (e.g., denoised amplitude).

**Loss Function:**
We typically use Mean Squared Error (MSE) or L1 Loss for signal reconstruction:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{MSE} = \frac{1}{N} \sum ||y_{true} - y_{pred}||^2
$$

For perceptual quality, we may combine this with an Adversarial Loss (GAN) or Perceptual Loss (VGG-based).

### Spectral Loss
To ensure frequency content is preserved during reconstruction, we employ a spectral loss term:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{total} = \mathcal{L}_{MSE} + \alpha \mathcal{L}_{spectral}
$$

Where:
$$ \mathcal{L}_{spectral} = || |\mathcal{F}(y)| - |\mathcal{F}(\hat{y})| ||^2 $$
$\mathcal{F}$ denotes the Fourier Transform magnitude. This penalizes blurriness and ensures high-frequency geologic features are recovered.
