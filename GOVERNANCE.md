# Governance

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Maintainers
Maintainers have write access to the repository and are responsible for:
*   Reviewing and merging Pull Requests.
*   Triaging Issues.
*   Making architectural decisions.
*   Enforcing the Code of Conduct.

### Contributors
Contributors are community members who submit code, documentation, or other contributions. They are responsible for adhering to the contributing guidelines and code of conduct.

## Decision Making

### Consensus
We strive for consensus on all major decisions. If consensus cannot be reached, the decision defaults to the Maintainers via a simple majority vote.

### Feature Requests
Major features require a Request for Comment (RFC) process where the design is discussed in a dedicated issue or document before implementation begins.

## Release Process
Releases are managed by Maintainers, strictly following Semantic Versioning. A release candidate is typically generated and tested before the final tag is pushed.
